The Personalized Medication Recommender is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist users in selecting appropriate medication based on their specific medical condition, severity, age, and other relevant factors. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their disease, severity level, age, sex, and any other medical conditions they may have. Based on these inputs, the application retrieves relevant medication recommendations from a predefined database.

Languages used:
---------------
1. Python: The primary programming language used for the backend logic, data processing, and interaction with Streamlit.
2. HTML/CSS (via Streamlit): Streamlit allows the incorporation of HTML and CSS for customizing the appearance and layout of the web application. HTML is used for structuring the content (e.g., headers, 
   paragraphs), while CSS can be used for styling elements (e.g., colors, fonts).
3. Markdown (via Streamlit): Streamlit supports Markdown for formatting text, creating headers, lists, and other textual elements within the application.
 
Key Features:
-------------
1. User Input: Users can select their disease, severity level, age, sex, and other medical conditions through interactive dropdown menus and sliders.
2. Medication Recommendations: The application retrieves medication recommendations from a database based on the user's inputs.
3. Terms and Conditions: Users are presented with terms and conditions regarding the use of the application and must agree before accessing the medication recommendations.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with.
This project aims to provide users with personalized medication recommendations tailored to their specific medical needs, promoting informed decision-making and healthcare management.
